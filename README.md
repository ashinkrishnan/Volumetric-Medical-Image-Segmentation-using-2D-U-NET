# Volumetric-Medical-Image-Segmentation-using-2D-U-NET

This is a volumetric image segmentation Repository using NFBS Skull-stripped dataset(preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/NFB_skullstripped/).The goal is to segment the brain tissues from the skull tissues using 2-D U_NET CNN,or generate a mask for the brain tissues from the MRI.
The process is divided into 3 steps
### 1.Data preprocessing
### 2.Building the 2D U-NET model
### 3.Predicting the mask using user provided dataset
